<h4>Technical Considerations</h4>
<p>For the case of the TCloud service to MS Azure:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical service offered by Transtelco is limited to the configurations of the LAN perimeter router to achieve connectivity with the virtual perimeter router in the cloud until the networks are interconnected at both ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The customer is responsible for their MS Azure cloud console service and all resource costs, as well as the data transfer rate from the cloud to the local network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The client must perform the hiring of the Express Route service from their cloud console and provide us with the identification tag to perform the interconnection with their cloud resources.</p>

  <h2>Current Situation</h2>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;The TCloud service offered is for 50 Mbps and is delivered in the Transtelco Network, so the total of the sites share this bandwidth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In case of requiring an increase in the capacity of the TCloud service to MS Azure, the increase of the bandwidth of the last mile accesses of the places where it is required should also be considered.</p>
<p>The Internet and Mesh / TCloud services share a predetermined bandwidth which can be configured according to the client's needs. In the case of a bandwidth of 35 Mbps, 15 can be distributed for the Internet and 20 for Mesh / TCloud.</p>
