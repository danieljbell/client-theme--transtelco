  <h2>Current Situation</h2>
  <img src="https://fillmurray.com/200/60" alt="">
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Financial ME-XI has 9 sites and a corporate office that need to improve their telecommunications infrastructure in order to make their daily operations more efficient, and with this, provide better services to their clients.</li>
  <li>They currently have digital telephony and Internet services dedicated as main access in all their branches.</li>
  <li>The tools and operating applications are hosted on servers in the MS Azure cloud, which makes it increasingly necessary to increase bandwidth and improve the availability of services.</li>
  <li>For the interconnection between branches and the corporate office, there are VPN tunnels, created through the Internet.</li>
  <li>An increase in the digital telephone service is required at the May 5 site due to the growth in the call center staff.</li>
</ul>
<div class="transtelco-full-bleed">
  <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Transtelco's proposal includes the services of Direct Access to Internet (DIA), Direct Interconnection with the MS Azure cloud (Tcloud MS Azure), Lan-to-Lan communication between all the sites and the corporate office (MESH), as well as as the IP Telephony service (TKS SIP) for 8 sites and the corporate office. The sites are detailed in the topological diagram.</li>
  <li>As part of the solution, routers are included, managed by certified Transtelco engineers so that, through the same port, they can communicate between their branches, the corporate office and the MS Azure cloud.</li>
  <li>The solution considers that the interconnection of each of the sites with the MS Azure cloud is a functionality supported in the Transtelco network, so that traffic from the sites to MS Azure is transported directly without going through the office corporate</li>
  <li>The offered telephony is of last generation delivering SIP Trunks in each site according to the needs of the client.</li>
